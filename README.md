# Impact of COVIS19 on Small Business and Entrepreneurship

# Overview of Problem and Why it Matters
The World Economic Forum states that 34% of small businesses in the U.S. are still closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there has been a spike in new business applications beginning in late 2020 and continuing into 2021 for non-traditional retail businesses. (http://www.nber.org/papers/w28912) Ten 3-digit NAICS industries account for 
75% of the surge. Dominant industries include Nonstore Retail (alone accounting for 33% of the surge), Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, Truck Transportation, and 
Accommodation and Food Services.

We would like to investigate the different factors affecting U.S. small businesses, with consideration in digitization, shut-downs, PPP loans, and their distributions methods. 

This investigation will help to provide a better understanding of what factors have affected small businesses more than others, whether that be internal or external factors and whether industry plays a part. Further, being able to identify these factors will enable small businesses to focus on key areas of improvement to work towards recovery. Additionally, businesses can utilize insights to enable growth within the current economic landscape.
